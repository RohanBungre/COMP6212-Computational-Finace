# COMP6212-Computational-Finace

## Module Description

Financial markets form the source of a vast number of challenging computational problems. These are not only intellectually challenging from the point of view of computational modelling, but the financial sector is also an employer of a significant fraction of graduates of Computer Science, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

This module covers two aspects of the use of computational processing in Finance: 
1. The use of computation in the analysis of finance algorithmic instruments. This includes the use of statistical analysis and machine learning. 
2. The computation and programming concepts behind cryptocurrencies.

## Skills Developed

Being able to:

1. Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of numerical methods to solve systems of linear equations, to compute quadratures and to solve Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations
2. Show logical thinking in coding a mathematical problem in algorithmic form
3. Analyse a mathematical problem and determine which numerical technique to use to solve it
4. Use a programming language such as Python, its instructions and its programming language
5. Use knowledge of a programming language such as Python to learn more easily any other programming language for the future.

## Technologies Used

1. Python
2. Numpy
3. Scipy
4. Matplotlib
5. MATLAB

## Repository Content

This repository contains code for 2 different pieces of coursework and one in-class test.

Each coursework demonstrates my ability to break down complex mathematical problems into easier computational problems.

It also contains the exam taken for this module.
