# COMP6212-Computational-Finace

## Module Description

Financial markets form the source of a vast number of challenging computational problems. These are not only intellectually challenging from the point of view of computational modelling, but the financial sector is also an employer of a significant fraction of graduates of Computer Science, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

This module covers two aspects of the use of computational processing in Finance: 
1. The use of computation in the analysis of finance algorithmic instruments. This includes the use of statistical analysis and machine learning. 
2. The computation and programming concepts behind cryptocurrencies.

## Skills Developed
